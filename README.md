# Gamma-minimax-learninng

Simulation code for "Leveraging vague prior information in general models via iteratively constructed Gamma-minimax estimators".

Folders with name starting with "univariate_mean" correspond to the simulation on estimating the mean.

`n_new_categories/` corresponds to the simulation on predicting the expected number of new categories. `entropy/` corresponds to the simulation on estimating the entropy. Among the subfolders, `1/`, `2/` and `3/` correspond to strongly informative, weakly informative and almost non-informative prior knowledge.
